# Documentation - `/docs`

## Overview

The **`/docs`** folder contains all the essential documentation files for the project. This includes detailed reports, technical specifications, design diagrams, and any other documents relevant to understanding and developing the project. The contents of this folder provide an in-depth look into the system architecture, design decisions, and overall project methodology.

### Files and Structure

- **`Project_Design.pdf`**: This document provides a comprehensive overview of the system design, including architecture, components, and interactions between different parts of the project.
- **`Requirements_Specifications.md`**: Describes the functional and non-functional requirements for the project, outlining what the system should accomplish, the constraints it operates under, and performance metrics.
- **`Testing_Procedure.md`**: Outlines the testing process, including test cases, expected outcomes, and instructions for running and evaluating tests.
- **`User_Manual.md`**: A user guide detailing how to use the system, from installation to troubleshooting.
- **`Design_Diagrams/`**: A folder containing visual diagrams such as UML, flowcharts, and architecture diagrams that explain the project's design and logic.

### How to Use

- **Viewing the Documents**: Most of the documents in this folder can be viewed in any Markdown viewer (for `.md` files) or PDF reader (for `.pdf` files). You can open them using any editor like Visual Studio Code or directly in your browser.
- **Contributing to Documentation**: If you want to update or add new documentation, simply edit the appropriate `.md` or `.pdf` file. Ensure that any new documents are placed in the appropriate folder and follow the same structure as the existing ones.

### Important Notes

- **Version Control**: Documentation should be versioned along with the source code to reflect the most up-to-date project state. Make sure to update relevant sections of the documentation whenever there are significant changes to the project.
- **Diagrams**: All diagrams in the `Design_Diagrams/` folder must be accompanied by a description in the appropriate documentation file, explaining the key points and significance of each diagram.
